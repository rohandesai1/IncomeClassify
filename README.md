# **Classify Income Bracket**
Using census datasets, this project aims to classify a given person's income bracket. This is done by cleaning/one-hot encoding the dataset using pandas, which is then fed into a random forest classifier model. 

full readme coming soon. (most code is contained in income_guesser.py, all datasets will soon be put into their own folder)
